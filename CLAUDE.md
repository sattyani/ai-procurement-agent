# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an AI procurements agent built with Python. The project is in its initial stages with a minimal setup containing a basic Python entry point.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Entry point for the application
- `pyproject.toml`: Python project configuration and dependencies
- `README.md`: Project documentation (currently empty)

## Development Commands

### Running the Application
```bash
python main.py
```

### Python Environment
- Requires Python >=3.13
- Uses pyproject.toml for dependency management
- Currently has no external dependencies

## Architecture Notes

The project is currently a simple Python application with a single entry point. As this is an AI procurements agent, it will likely expand to include:
- AI/ML model integration
- Procurement data processing
- API endpoints or CLI interfaces
- Database interactions for procurement data

The current structure suggests this is a foundational setup that will grow as the procurement agent functionality is developed.
